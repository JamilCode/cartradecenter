				Under the hood, the Maruti Alto 800 houses a three-cylinder naturally aspirated 0.8 L engine that may seem modest on paper but delivers a powerful performance. Whether navigating steep hills or maneuvering through congested town lanes, the engine's 47 bhp with 69 Nm of torque (or 40 bhp with 60 Nm of torque in CNG) ensures a smooth and reliable ride. The well-crafted cabin, adorned with quality plastics and a range of features, elevates the driving experience beyond the typical entry-level car.

With nearly a quarter-century on the roads, this little powerhouse commands a premium in the second-hand car market. Well-maintained units with low mileage continue to fetch resale prices that defy their initial cost. The ease of selling through established brands in the second-hand market, along with the rising popularity of online platforms, makes parting with your Alto 800 a hassle-free experience.
